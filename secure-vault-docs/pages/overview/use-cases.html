            <h1>Use Cases</h1>
            <p>The Secure Intelligence Document Vault is designed to serve organizations with the most demanding
                security and compliance requirements. The following use cases demonstrate the system's versatility
                across government, defense, healthcare, legal, and financial sectors.</p>

            <h2 id="intelligence">Intelligence Agencies</h2>
            <p>For agencies managing classified intelligence products, the vault provides compartmentalized document
                storage with FIPS 140-3 Level 3 cryptographic protection. The 5-tier classification system (UNCLASSIFIED
                through TOP SECRET) with need-to-know compartmentalization ensures information is accessible only to
                personnel with appropriate clearance and authorization.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Compartmentalized access with classification-based enforcement</li>
                <li>Immutable audit trail for chain of custody tracking</li>
                <li>Emergency override procedures with automatic escalation</li>
                <li>Air-gapped deployment option for sensitive environments</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="defense">Defense Contractors</h2>
            <p>Defense contractors handling Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) and Federal Contract Information
                (FCI) must comply with NIST SP 800-171/172. The vault provides a turnkey solution that satisfies all
                110+ security requirements, reducing the compliance burden and accelerating CMMC certification.</p>

            <h2 id="government">Government Agencies</h2>
            <p>Federal and state agencies require NIST-compliant document management systems that integrate with
                existing IT infrastructure. The vault's cloud-agnostic design supports deployment on AWS GovCloud, Azure
                Government, and on-premise environments, with FedRAMP-ready security architecture.</p>

            <h2 id="healthcare">Healthcare Organizations</h2>
            <p>Medical records require HIPAA-compliant storage with encryption at rest and in transit, role-based access
                for clinical staff, and comprehensive audit logging for compliance. The vault exceeds HIPAA requirements
                through its defense-in-depth security model and 7-year+ retention capabilities.</p>

            <h2 id="legal">Legal Firms</h2>
            <p>Attorney-client privileged documents demand strict access controls, version tracking, and immutable audit
                trails. The vault's document versioning, sharing and delegation workflows, and tamper-proof logging
                ensure the integrity and confidentiality of legal records.</p>

            <h2 id="financial">Financial Services</h2>
            <p>SEC/FINRA document retention requirements mandate WORM-compliant storage with 7-year retention periods.
                The vault's append-only audit architecture, automated archival, and compliance reporting capabilities
                directly address financial regulatory requirements.</p>
